# Digital Financial Fraud:Analysis of Payment Data with Machine Learning

Analyzed a time series dataset on digital financial fraud to develop a predictive model that can identify potential fraud
cases
• Overcame the challenge of the dataset of 6 million rows being highly imbalanced by conducting a detailed exploration
and cleaning of the data, including identifying and correcting possible discrepancies in the dataset’s description
• Implemented cutting-edge machine learning methods, including feature engineering and extreme gradient-boosted
decision trees, to develop a highly accurate predictive model
• Achieved an enhanced predictive power of 0.997, as measured by the area under the precision-recall curve, indicating a
high level of accuracy in identifying potential fraud cases
